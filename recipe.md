Instructions
Preheat Oven to 350 degrees.
Grease an 8" square casserole dish (for a round cake you can use one 9" cake pan).
Sift the dry ingredients together and stir with a fork until well-mixed. Make three wells in the dry ingredients. Pour the oil into the first well, the vinegar into the second, and the vanilla into the third. Pour the cold water over the top of it all, then stir with a fork until well-blended. Pour into greased pan and bake at 350 for about 25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let it cool, then frost.
For the frosting:
Cream together the butter, sugar, cocoa and salt until well-mixed. Add the liquid and beat until fluffy.
